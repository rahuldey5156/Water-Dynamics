Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) is a key metric used in Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to analyse the dynamics of water (or any molecule) over time. It measures how far a molecule (or atom) moves from its initial position as a function of time, providing insights into the diffusion behaviour and mobility of the molecules. 
The MSD is defined as:
$MSD(t) = \langle |r_i(t) - r_i(0)|^2 \rangle$
