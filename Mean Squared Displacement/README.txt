Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) is a key metric used in Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to analyse the dynamics of water (or any molecule) over time. It measures how far a molecule (or atom) moves from its initial position as a function of time, providing insights into the diffusion behaviour and mobility of the molecules. It measures the average squared distance that a molecule travels from its starting point over time.
