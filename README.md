Water dynamics analysis around a protein in Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations involves studying how water molecules interact with the protein at an atomic level. This analysis helps to understand the role of water in protein stability, folding, binding, and overall function. Since water is a crucial component of the biological environment, its behaviour around proteins can provide insights into mechanisms of molecular recognition, conformational changes, and enzymatic activity.
