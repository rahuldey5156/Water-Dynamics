The residential time correlation function (RTCF) is used in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to quantify how long water molecules remain associated with a particular region of a protein, such as its surface or binding pocket. It provides insights into the dynamics of hydration water and how water molecules interact with the protein over time, which is crucial for understanding protein stability, folding, and function.
