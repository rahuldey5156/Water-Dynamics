In Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, a protein-water hydrogen bond (H-bond) refers to the formation of a hydrogen bond between a protein and surrounding water molecules. Hydrogen bonds play a crucial role in maintaining protein structure, stability, and function by facilitating interactions with the aqueous environment.

A hydrogen bond in MD simulations is typically defined based on two key geometric criteria:
1) Distance criterion – The distance between the hydrogen bond donor (D) and the acceptor (A) should be within a specific cutoff.
2) Angle criterion – The angle between the donor–hydrogen–acceptor (D-H···A) should be within a specific range.

In protein-water interactions:
1) Donor -- Protein side chain or backbone amine (-NH) or hydroxyl (-OH) groups.
2) Acceptor -- Water oxygen or protein side chain/carbonyl oxygen.

Protein-water H-bonds can be classified into continuous and intermittent based on their lifetime and stability during the simulation:
1) Continuous Hydrogen Bonds: A H-bond is considered continuous when it remains intact over a prolonged period without significant disruption. In MD terms, this means that the donor-acceptor distance and angle criteria are satisfied continuously over a threshold time window.
2) Intermittent Hydrogen Bonds: A H-bond is considered intermittent if it breaks and reforms frequently during the simulation. In MD terms, the H-bond criteria are satisfied only for short, non-consecutive time periods.

Requirements:
1) VMD TCL Scripting
2) Numpy library of Python

Use:
1) First run the TCL script. It will create 3 datafiles - donor.dat, acceptor.dat and donor_hydrogen.dat.
2) Then any of the python script (continuous or intermittent) as per requirement.
3) Make sure the name of the datafiles are system_0ns.pdb and analysis.xtc for the TCL script to run. Otherwise change the names in the script.
4) Output filename will be continuous_protein_water_hbond.dat or intermittent_protein_water_hbond.dat (depending the python script used).

Additional:
1) Here we have considered water molecules that are around 5.5 Angstrom distance from protein molecule. Change the cutoff distance as per need in the TCL script.
2) Change the distance criterion and angle criterion in the TCL script if needed.
4) Make sure the input files contain hydrogen atoms of the water molecule. Process the pdb and xtc files accordingly. In the TCL script, the Hydrogen atoms of protein are not considered, so it can be kept in the input files.
5) Here we have analyzed all the frames of the entire trajectory. Change it as per needed in the TCL script.
